          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>
            The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            The h1 element is the biggest heading on the page. There is only one
            per webpage. The other heading elements are h2 to h6 and these can
            be repeated.
          </li>
          <li>The p element is a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>
            Remember to wrap a list item within the ul element. List items can
            be unnumbered or numbered.

            A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.

          <li>
            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            an element.

          <li>A box shadow adds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>

          <li>
            The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The
            declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by
            semicolons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated
            by a colon. Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons,
            and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

            A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our
            code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a
            script.
          </li>
          <li>
            An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data
            that is related in some way.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in
            case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript
            code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.
          </li>
          <li>
            When we declare a function in JavaScript code, we are creating a
            reusable block of code that performs a specific task. We then need
            to call the function in the code at the spot where we want it to
            execute.
          </li>
          <li>
            The JavaScript file needs to be linked in the HTML file at the
            bottom before the end of the body.
