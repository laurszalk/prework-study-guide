            Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in
            case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript
            code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.
          </li>
          <li>
            When we declare a function in JavaScript code, we are creating a
            reusable block of code that performs a specific task. We then need
            to call the function in the code at the spot where we want it to
            execute.
