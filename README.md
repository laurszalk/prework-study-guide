# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a Prework Study Guide for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Git work flow in preparation for the coding bootcamp. The webpage both provides useful notes on each of these topics and shows practical application of the learning I've done throughout the prework course. It will be a useful study guide that I can return to and keep adding to as a foundation for the bootcamp.
